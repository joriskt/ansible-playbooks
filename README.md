# ansible-collections

## Dependencies

### `community.general` collection

See the [Ansible docs](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections_guide/collections_installing.html) on how to install collections.

At the time of writing, this should work:
```bash
$ ansible-galaxy collection install community.general
```
